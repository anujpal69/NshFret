                        <h1>What Is Ocean Freight Shipping?</h1>

                        <p>Ocean freight shipping, also known as sea freight or ocean cargo, refers to the
                            transportation of goods
                            by ship across the world's oceans. This method of shipping is ideal for large, heavy, or
                            bulky cargo
                            that requires efficient and cost-effective transportation over long distances. Ocean freight
                            shipping
                            involves the use of various types of vessels, including container ships, bulk carriers,
                            tankers, and
                            roll-on/roll-off ships, to transport goods from one port to another.</p>

                        <p>Ocean freight shipping is a critical component of international trade, enabling businesses to
                            import and
                            export goods globally. This shipping method offers numerous benefits, including:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> High volume capacity, making it suitable for large shipments</li>
                            <li> Cost-effectiveness for heavy or bulky cargo</li>
                            <li> Environmental benefits compared to air freight</li>
