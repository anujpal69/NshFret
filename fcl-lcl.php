                                (less than 15 cubic meters). LCL also allows you to save on storage by shipping smaller

                                method. Generally, FCL is more cost-effective than LCL, with fewer handling operations
                                for transporters and faster delivery times, as there’s no need for grouping or
                                separating goods. However, FCL pricing can fluctuate, particularly based on available
