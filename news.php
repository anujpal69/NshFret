                <p>Fresh from a great result at the world-renowned Bol d’Or in Geneva on Sunday 16 June, the NSH Sailing Team will soon take part in one of the most important regattas in Spain; the Trofeo SM La Reina, to be held from 5 to 7 July in Valencia.</p>
                <p>This regatta, which has been held since 1988, is a benchmark in the national and international sailing circuit. On this occasion, the NSH Sailing Team will make its debut in the ORC 3 class with a Dufour 40 LADY model boat, facing a new challenge as this will be the first time it competes in this class.</p>
                <p>The team will be led by Nicolas Groux, skipper and professional sailor, and accompanied by Santi Más, representative of the owner. Seven members of the NSH sailing team, all employees of NSH’s Headquarters in Geneva, will complete the crew for this race.</p>
                <p><strong>Olivier Raison, Deputy Head of global Insurance, Legal and Claims</strong>, and managing member of the NSH Sailing team said "We are thrilled to be back here in Valencia for the Trofeo S.M La Reina. Valencia is an important hub for NSH and to meet and share experiences with the Valencia team for a few days is a real privilege for us. It is also a fantastic race and we look forward to some tough competition.” </p>
                <p>Valencia is one of NSH's main home ports in the Mediterranean and is a very special city for the team, not only because of its excellent sailing conditions, but also because it is a place that has seen NSH Spain grow for more than 40 years. </p>
                <p><strong>Carolina Lorente, Branch Manager of NSH Valencia</strong>, said, “It is great to welcome the NSH crew back to Valencia and we all look forward to the racing. This regatta is a major benchmark on the national and international sailing circuit, and we are very pleased to see NSH’s name in the fleet".</p>
                <p>
